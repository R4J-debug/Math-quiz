## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Concurrency Solution
```
User A submits answer → Server validates → Records timestamp
User B submits answer → Server validates → Too late!
                         ↓
                    Only first correct answer wins
                    Server timestamp is authoritative
```

### Question Generation
- **8 Types**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, algebra, squares, modulo, mixed
- **Dynamic**: Generated on-the-fly, no external API
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Easy (1★) → Medium (2★) → Hard (3★)
- **Point System**: Difficulty × 10 points

### Network Handling
- **Primary**: WebSocket (fast, bidirectional)
- **Fallback**: Long polling (reliable, works everywhere)
- **Reconnection**: Automatic on network loss
- **Fairness**: Server timestamp prevents client-side cheating

## 🔒 Production Considerations

### Corners Cut (Documented)

1. **Storage**: In-memory (would use Redis + PostgreSQL)
2. **Auth**: No authentication (would use JWT/OAuth)
3. **Security**: Basic validation (would add rate limiting, sanitization)
4. **Testing**: Manual only (would add Jest + RTL)
5. **Monitoring**: None (would add Sentry, logging)
6. **Scaling**: Single server (would add load balancer, multiple instances)

### Why These Cuts Were Made
- ⏰ 2-3 hour time constraint
- 🎯 Focus on core features
- ✅ MVP first, scale later approach
- 📝 All improvements documented for discussion

## 🎤 Discussion Prep

### What I Did
Built a full-stack real-time competitive math quiz with:
- Fair concurrency handling using Socket.io
- Dynamic question generation (no external dependencies)
- Network-resilient real-time updates
- High score tracking system
- Comprehensive documentation

### How I Did It
- **Concurrency**: Server-side timestamp validation ensures first correct answer wins
- **Real-time**: Socket.io WebSocket with automatic fallback to polling
- **Questions**: Custom generator with 8 types and 3 difficulties
- **Fairness**: Server timestamp is authoritative (prevents network speed advantage)
- **UX**: React with real-time state updates and smooth animations

### Why These Choices
- **Socket.io**: Best tool for concurrency + network handling
- **React**: Fast development with excellent real-time capabilities
- **Node.js**: Perfect for async, event-driven architecture
- **In-memory**: Fastest MVP path (production path documented)
- **No external APIs**: Reliability and speed

### Time Management
- Prioritized core features first
- Used modern tools (Vite, Socket.io) to move fast
- Cut non-essential features (auth, testing, DB)
- Documented everything for production discussion
